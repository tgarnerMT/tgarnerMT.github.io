1: Explain how web browsers function.

Web browsers 

2: Define and describe DOM.

The Document Object Model, effectively an object representation of the document made up of nodes. These can be any element and usually include (in HTML's case) some form of CSS for styling.

3: What is the difference between HTML, XML, and XHTML?

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the foundation and structure of a web pages content.

XML: Extensible Markup Language is used to describe document nodes (where as HTML displays them). Allows for elements to update without having to refresh an entire page (wasn't aware of this, very interesting!)

XHTML: Extensible Hypertext Markup Language is basically a bridge between HTML and XML, which attempts to correct some issues that can be seen on mobilie devices

4: What are the 4 elements of your HTML pages need?

The main types are:

Doctype 
root
Head
Body

5: What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?

The index is the master HTML file (or, more simply put, the 'first' page you see)

This page goes in the main folder for the directory (ie, the top most folder).

6: Review What are some of the best naming practices?

While naming conventions are subjective in nature, the 'best practices' are usually simplicity and clarity. There should be folders for CSS, photos (usually names 'images' or similar), and folders for additional pages.

The idea of this is to allow those who are not familiar with your coding style to easily locate items in the event that they need to make adjustments (this is particularly important for larger coding companies and developers)
