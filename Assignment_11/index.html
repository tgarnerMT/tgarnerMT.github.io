        A Dyson Sphere is a theoretical super-structure that encases a star and absorbs the energy from the light generated by the star.
        Generally speaking, Dyson Spheres are possible but do come with several caveats that make them practically impossible to implement in reality.<br><br>
        Aside from the impracticality of acquiring such a vast pool of resources (an amount required to encircle an entire star) the primary issue is that the star in question is the largest gravitational force in the solar system.
        Due to this, when objects are pulled toward it they will collide with the Dyson Sphere and cause damage to the structure.

        <p>A much more practical method of creating a power super-structure is a Dyson Swarm. This 'swarm' is comprised of small reflective panels that redirect light towards central collection stations.
            These collection stations then focus the collected light into a beam and send it to its intended destination.

            Ultimately, the construciton of super-structures is possible, but the feat of engineering required to even begin such a task is well outside our current capabilities.
