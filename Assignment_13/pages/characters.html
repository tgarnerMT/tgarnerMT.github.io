        <h1>Characters</h1>

        <p>Characters in game are the units with which both the player and NPC's interact with each other. <br>
        These characters can be of varying races, but generally are divided into 4 categories:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Humanoid</li>
            <li>Animal</li>
            <li>Mech</li>
            <li>Insect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each type of character has its own behavioral quirks, defensive and offensive stats, and body parts that make up its bonus' and weaknesses.</p>
