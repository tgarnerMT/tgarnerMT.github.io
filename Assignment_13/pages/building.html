        <h1>Buildings</h1>
        <p>Building is a key feature of Rimworld and ultimately the design, size and shape of your (or your enemies) buildings determine the function and defenses of the buildings.<br>
        Buildings can be constructed using different materials which impact their defensive stats and their weakness to certain environmental effects (such as fire)<br>
        Buildings are designed to contain tables, beds, and other furniture that can be used by characters to perform tasks.
