        <h3>Game Premise</h3>

        <p>Rimworld is a colony survival based game, meaning you 'control' multiple characters with the goal of surviving as a colony.<br>
            Rimworld's story involves multiple different origin tracks, but ultimately you are stranded for some reason and end up with 'x' people.<br>
            You'll have to avoid dying from events, starvation, disease, etc. all the while making sure that you grow so that you can build a spaceship to leave the planet.</p>

        <h3>Mechanics</h3>

        <p>
            Rimworld has several mechanics, but I'll list the most broad and commonly interacted with ones below:
            <ul>
                <li>Hunger</li>
                <li>Sleep</li>
                <li>Combat</li>
                <li>Research</li>
                <li>Mood (Happiness)</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Playtime/Length</h3>

        <p>While the game has nearly infinite replayability, a single playthrough of a completely randomized campain could take over a hundred hours.<br>
            However, considering that the game has a near infinite amount of scenarios that can be played out, you can expect easily over a thousand hours.
        </p>
