What is an advantage to using a text editor?

Using Text Editors enables faster editing and fewer mistakes.

(in this case, I actually choose to use an IDE, as I'm far more familiar and comfortable in VS_Code than I am in Atom or other text editors)

Is there an advantage of using a relative vs an absolute URL?

While the differences are small, relative URL's actually provide a faster loading time.
That said, absolute URL's have better security and are ultimately more reliable.
Use case will depend on which you choose to use.
